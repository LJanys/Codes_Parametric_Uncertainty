 When running the codes on your own machine, follow the Read me instructions in the sampling-recalculate-likelihoods folder.
 
These files are necessary to simulate our model on a computing cluster. To generate the samples, you have to first set up the environment env_server.yml. Then you can run the bash file create_sample.sh that activates the environment and runs the simulation script create_sample.py that should be saved in the same folder.
